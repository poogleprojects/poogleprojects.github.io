⚔️ Strategy Tips

Don't rush travel — gather resources and craft gear before pushing into harder biomes Food is life — you lose 1 food per turn + extra when traveling. Hunt often! Craft early — even a Wooden Club and Leather Tunic dramatically improve survival Save potions — you can use them mid-combat for clutch heals Explore for bonus loot, but beware of dangerous events in later biomes Enjoy the journey to Valhalla, warrior! ⚔️🏔️
